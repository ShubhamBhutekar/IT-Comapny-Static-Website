        <h2>IT-SOLUTION</h2>

        <p>In the 1980s, some VARs began marketing themselves as solution sellers or solution providers -- a label that
            many channel partners continue to use today. VARs and channel partners learned to get close to their
            customers, learn about their pain points and then bundle products to solve their problems. Systems
            integrators also emerged under the solution provider banner, offering a mix of consulting, software
            customization and implementation services. In the 1990s, VARs began to offer consulting and other
            professional services to complement their turnkey solutions.
            he rapid growth of local area networks in the late 1980s and early 1990s gave rise to network solutions, as
            customers requested help in designing, installing and supporting networks. Network-oriented resellers, also
            known as network integrators, initially focused on Novell's NetWare product, but eventually shifted their
            network solutions' emphasis to Windows and open source operating systems, as those software platforms gained
            networking capabilities.

            talent in the Performance - Potential grid..</p>
